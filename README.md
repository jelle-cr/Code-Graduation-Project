I have created this code to support the research of my graduation project, where I investigate Artificial Potential Fields (APFs), Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), and possible crossovers between the two techniques.

This code has been created and tested on the 2024a version of MATLAB. Downgrading may be possible. However, the backgroundAlpha property used in the plotting legends is only supported from 2024a and onwards.
